#Final Presentation - 3rd December 1:30 pm (Product owner: Ilter Canberk)


* **Implementing the stub generator for reload_... method

reload_... method is similar to html_... but instead of only passing the string, it will actually find the parent view of the element and replace the html string inside it.

Expected time: 3 hours

* **Implementing the stub generator json_... method

json_... method is again similar to html_... but instead of a string it will get the JSON representation and pass it as a callback.

Expected time: 1 hour

* **Injecting methods into the HTML page
Debugging why injecting the jQuery library CDN is not allowing the application to function.

* **Debugging and creating a sample application

The sample application will help the users to understand how to use the various features of the framework within Django. The application will exercise all features of the framework to help the users understand the power behind the framework.

Expected time: 1 hour writing the application (because the whole thing is about speed) + 5 hours of debugging

* **Registering the package with PIP registry

We would like other developers to use it, so we will register the library to PIP registery. This way people can do pip install django-interactive and start using it in their applications.

Expected time: 1.5 hour

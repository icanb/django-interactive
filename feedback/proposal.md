You have laid out some pretty deep-rooted issues with modern web development, but the proposal does not contain enough detail on how you plan to tackle the problems and what the scope of the project will approximately be. In the "Layers" section, you mentioned parts of the web framework you would like to build. While it is challenging to build these layers, I am struggling to see how building those layers can solve the problems you indicated in the "Problems" section. You should try to focus the project on solving one or two specific problems you have identified, and then rewrite a proposal that concentrates on these features. This would give you (and us) a much more informative picture on the direction and scope of the project.

Hi Ilter and Naman,

I'm concerned that your framework proposal, in its current form, is not yet well-enough defined to satisfy the requirements of the project proposal.  In your proposal you outline numerous options that you might explore, but the proposal itself does not yet define which of those options you will actually try to achieve in your project.

If you plan to develop a web framework as your project, I strongly recommend that you revise your proposal to include concrete, specific goals, and also define some of the technical choices and limitations (such as what languages and/or underlying frameworks you will use) for your project.  Currently you describe a range of possible goals, but (1) the current range of goals is clearly too broad for a single course project, and (2) I don't yet understand any (even high-level) details of your technical approach, which prevents me from evaluating the feasibility of your proposal.  

In its current form I consider your proposal to be very risky; it is possible that it will not give you an adequate opportunity to demonstrate the skills of the course.  This evaluation, though, is largely due to the breadth and lack of details I cited above, not because the fundamental idea (developing or extending a framework) is flawed.

Best wishes,
-charlie

(Updated based on Proposal 2): This is a pretty advanced assignment. I know you likely have the technical expertise for this, but be sure you're comfortable with developing this and turning it in. Additionally, do you plan to release this after the class is finished? (Could be a really cool OS contribution). 

### Shannon
In general, a web framework would be a great idea for a project.

However, there are two main concerns with this proposal. One is that unless you set your objectives to be very specific and reachable, then this may be too large a project for a group of two. A framework is a large task, and without a clear goal, just designing it could take up the entire project time period. The other concern is that it's not clear what you are ballparking (I guess this is related to the previous concern) and you should spend a long time researching feasibility. You've done some competitive analysis, but it's not clear how well Swift can support a framework like this (though I admit I am not too familiar with Swift).
